React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications with ease. It follows a component-based architecture, where each piece of the user interface is represented as a reusable component. React efficiently updates and renders components when the underlying data changes, making it a popular choice for building modern web applications.
